## __About Me__
My name is Alexander Leshko. I was born and raised in a small town called Stolin. I studied at the gymnasium there and successfully completed it in 2018. After that, I entered the Belarusian State University of Informatics and Radioelectronics at the Faculty of Radio Engineering and Electronics, specializing in electronic information protection for the budget. In 2022 I successfully defended my diploma and graduated. Seems like nothing in common between me and a programmer? In truth, studying at the university did not bring me pleasure. Even in the 1st year, I was sent to retake C++ 5 times, but not because of knowledge, but because I passed the labs at the wrong time. After that I decided that in no case I would connect my life with programming. But in the course of studying at the university, I met one teacher who was fond of developing mobile applications on Dart(Flutter) and so he directed me to the right path :) In 2 months I learned the basics of Dart (Flutter) and even wrote my first mobile application. Later I became interested in other languages. Learned SQL in a few days. Then I got acquainted with HTML and CSS, which I really liked. Having studied HTML and CSS well enough, I applied for the free courses of Rolling Scopes School. I liked the training there, I was spending 12-14 hours per day on layout and, surprisingly, did not burn out at all. But at some point, the layout task began to require JavaScript, which I didnâ€™t know at all. So, I left the course... To learn this JavaScript :)
